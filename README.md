# A short reflection on this school project

After a year of studying Multimedia design, I still find it a bit challenging with delegating my time on tasks, and knowing what to prioritize vs what not to. Especially when it comes to working on multiple pages like this one, but despite all of the struggles I am generally happy with the result.

 However, having said that, I will already let you know I had completely forgotten about making a burger menu in mobile view, so good luck navigating around on a smaller viewport than 600px. ü§•

## So, what are some more practical take-aways?

In earlier assignments, I have often had the responsibility to work with slugs and data fetching, so that in itself wasn't too hard for me to figure out. 

I believe the main struggles have been to figure out how to make things as least complicated as possible. Especially with styling and structuring the websites and/or components. It sometimes feel as if I have to jump between dedicated .css files, to pages and/or to components to be able to get the right train of action going on. But towards the end I was actually able to figure out how to communicate "across" files, which propbably would have saved me some hours üòµ‚Äçüí´

In this example above, I am inside the component of **SingleViewCard.astro**, where I want the **TitleColored.astro** component to change colour when the *entire card* is being ***hovered***. All of this because I wanted to be able to reuse my one component instead of creating a new one or copying the one I already had. 

As a general, I feel as if I have gained a much better understanding of the usability of working with components, especially after we learnt about the use of **[data-theme]** values in CSS.
